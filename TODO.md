# Tasks
* Tracing and benchmarking with logger instead of `stdout`
* Retry
* Logging methods that take and return `String`
* Use `gradle`
* In `Cached` and `AppendLogContext`, try to make it work with the annotation in any parameter, not just the first one
* javadocs
* Try to get jacoco working

# Maybe? Just for practice
* Security, authentication & authorization
* Transactions
* Concurrency (Lock acquiring and releasing)
* Dependency injection
