# Tasks
* Benchmarking with logger instead of `stdout`
* Logging methods that take and return `String`
* Use `gradle`
* javadocs
* Try to get jacoco working

# Maybe? Just for practice
* Security, authentication & authorization
* Transactions
* Concurrency (Lock acquiring and releasing)
* Dependency injection
* Some type of validation?
