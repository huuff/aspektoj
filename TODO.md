* Actually check whether my artifact is deployed to central, I'm unsure about it...

# Tasks
* Tracing and benchmarking with logger instead of `stdout`
* Retry
* Timeout method
* Logging methods that take and return `String`
* Use `gradle`

# Maybe? Just for practice
* Security, authentication & authorization
* Transactions
* Concurrency (Lock acquiring and releasing)
* Dependency injection
